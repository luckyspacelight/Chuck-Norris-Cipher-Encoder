<h2>Creating instances</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Packages allow you to access both constructors and static methods. </p>
<p>Now you're working with an application that multiplies a provided number by 200. There's a special class that is used for operating on large numbers called <code class="java">BigInteger</code>. </p>
<p>In this task, you will need to access this class <em>without importing it</em>. Its constructor accepts only one argument: a string with a number (for example, "1264"). It is located in the <code class="java">java.math</code> package. <br/>
<br/>
You need to create an instance of this class with the number given in the method, and return it.</p>
<p>The program will then multiply it â€“ you <em>don't </em>need to perform multiplication.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">49225</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">49225 multiplied by 200 is 9845000<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
